# Sean's ReadMe

## üë®‚Äçüíª About me

Like me this is a work in progress.

### ‚öñÔ∏è My Values

1. Integrity - We do what we say and we say what we do
2. Growth Mindset - Be a sponge; never stop learning
3. Vision-driven - Identify future impact and inspire action from others
4. Family First - Family before work, always
5. Empathy - Care deeply about those around us and seek to understand

### üß† My Leadership Philosophy

* Care deeply, Challenge directly
* Empower exceptional humans to be their best selves
* Vulnerability builds trust, trust enables candor, candor drives growth, growth creates impact
* Feedback is a gift - give and receive it generously
* Pragmatism over dogmatism in all things
* Just enough process to be effective
* Progress is the best motivator, mattering is the best reward
* Recognize Achievements, Celebrate Accomplishments

### On Software Development

#### On architecture...

> There is no panacea in software development, merely pros and cons; we take the pros and do our best to mitigate the cons

#### On testing...

> Test 100% of the things **that matter**.

A simple testing framework for getting started with what to test:

1. Does it do what you intended it to do?
2. Does it do **only** what you intended it to do?
3. Does it do **only** what you intended it to do exactly once?

#### On best practices...

A simple learning progression for software engineers:

1. What are the best practices and patterns? When in doubt, default to best practices.
2. Why do those best practices and patterns exist?
3. When am I allowed to break them?

### üíé Seanisms

In 2023, a team member shared with me that they had brought some of the words and phrases I often say into their home sharing them with their family. They lovingly dubbed them "Seanisms" and I so graciously have adopted it here.

> How are you going to win this day?!?!

> Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible

> Eat the frog

> If you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always got

> What you measure is what you get

> What is the goal of the goal?

> Be a sponge!

> What needs to be true for this to work?

> Words matter. What you say matters.

> I make suggestions, you make decisions

### ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My superpowers

* Communicator - I translate so that people (from all areas of the organization) talk with each other, not past each other
* Storyteller - I illustrate technical complexity as clear visuals creating a narrative that reveals the "why" behind initiatives and help teams see how their work creates impact.
* Team-builder - I create high performing teams that deliver impact without sacrificing humanity
* Talent-amplifier - I recognize the potential in others and move them past their imposter syndrome

### üå± My areas of opportunity

We all have spots in our garden that could use a little more tending; here's what currently has my focus in 2025...

#### üßΩ Be a Sponge

Everyone has something to teach you. Don't squander opportunities to learn from others; be a sponge.

#### No Shortcuts

You have to make the time and put in the work to get better. Remove the barriers that prevent you from getting started. You have to do the reps; no shortcuts.

#### Let Them

Your power lies not in controlling others' actions, but in giving them permission to show you who they really are. Let them be them so that you can do you.

## ü§ù Working together

### [‚ù§Ô∏è:‚ù§Ô∏è's (1:1's)](one-on-ones.md) are the most important part of my work week

* If I do not know the answer to a question I will be honest with you and work to find out on your behalf.
* If I cannot share the answer to a question I will be honest in sharing that this is something I cannot answer at this time.
* This time is yours to use in a manner that best supports your growth and development.
* If you're looking for a starting point for talking points check out my [starter template](one-on-ones.md)
* I want to get to know you as a person, we can talk about more than just work
* If these become a status update I've failed you

### üéÅ Feedback

* Favor advice over feedback

### ‚≠ê My expectations for myself and others

1. We treat others with kindness and dignity.
2. We are adults capable of operating in an environment that affords autonomy and agency.
3. I will not have all the answers. I do not expect you to have all the answers either.
4. We hold each other accountable for our actions, own up to our mistakes, and give each other grace and support when we make them.

### üí¨ Communication

* Slack me when you need me

### ‚è∞ Time

* I work 8 - 4 Eastern Time
* I reserve my mornings for deep work
* I keep my calendar up-to-date; if you need a time to chat feel free to book some time with me
